# Hospital-Management-System
“Design and implementation of online hospital management system” is Ecofriendly in use. The project’s motive is to do paperless work in hospitals. The
data of patient were collected in database for better results. The unique think is
that only patients Id is required for his/her contact and treatment information.
Previously when the information was written on paper, it was very typical to
handle and care for long time for hospital. If data is lost, we haven’t any
corresponding options for that but when we save the data on database tables
we easily fetch it. Sometimes the patient’s previous information is also
important for the new treatment, so were in project the enquiry of patients is
also available to fulfill the consultant’s requirement about the history of the
patient. Not only of patients information is fetched but doctors and staffs
information like their contact details, salary, joining date, duty time,
qualification etc. are available through their Ids from database.
